# Drawing-Rectangles
Create a program that draws rectangles to the screen based on inputs from the user.
Prompt the user to enter the number of rectangles they would like to enter (up to 5).
Then ask the user for x and y coordinates, width, and height of each of the rectangles.
Then display the rectangles layered and laid out on a grid according to the user’s input.
